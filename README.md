# MNIST_classification_SVM_scratch
MNIST digit classification using SVMs 

The MNIST database is a database that contains data of handwritten digits.
Each digit is in the form of a 28x28 pixel grid. The intensity of each pixel is stored in the database

The project is aimed at predicting the handwritten digit, using the given database.

The project uses the MNIST dataset and predicts the digit using the given training data using support 
vector machines. Both linear and Gaussian kernels have been used, and implemented from scratch

The script linearsvm.m has the linear kernel implementation. 
The script start_gauss.m has the Gaussian kernel implementation.


The code is written in MATLAB
