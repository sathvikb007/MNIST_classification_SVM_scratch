# MNIST_classification_SVM_scratch
MNIST classification using SVMs 


The project uses the MNIST dataset and predicts the digit using the given training data using support 
vector machines. Both linear and Gaussian kernels have been used, and implemented from scratch

The script linearsvm.m has the linear kernel implementation
The script start_gauss.m has the Gaussian kernel implementation
